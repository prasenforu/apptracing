In this sample we will deploy a simple application that displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. Displayed on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and so on), and a few book reviews.

The BookInfo application is broken into four separate microservices:

- productpage. The productpage microservice calls the details and reviews microservices to populate the page.
- details. The details microservice contains book information.
- reviews. The reviews microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the ratings microservice.
- ratings. The ratings microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.

There are 3 versions of the reviews microservice:

- Version v1 doesn’t call the ratings service.
- Version v2 calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 black stars.
- Version v3 calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 red stars.
